London Underground Data
=======================

A json file containing data on the London Underground network, including lines, stations, distances between stations
and running times.

Data is all imported from an Excel spreadsheet found on an FOI request by Rayleigh Collins at:
https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/distance_between_adjacent_underg

To add:
 - Stations since 2008 (seems to be where the document I found)
 - DLR
 - Zone info

I'm in 2 minds about whether to keep the running times. It may depend on whether that data can be found for the
currently missing stations, and I'm not sure how useful it would be in its current form anyway.
